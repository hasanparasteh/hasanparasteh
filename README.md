<p>A full stack web developer is a person who can develop both client and server software. <b>I AM THE PERSON IN THAT DEFINITION</b>! For me every day is a learning day and I enjoy writing codes and then refactoring it more and more untill reach the point of being perfect..</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>I can master all the techniques involved in a development project 📦</li>
    <li>I can make a prototype very rapidly 🚀</li>
    <li>I can provide help to all the team members 😊</li>
    <li>I can reduce the time used for team communication 🤭</li>
    <li>I can switch between front and back end development based on requirements 🏃</li>

  </ul>
